    # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
    # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
    # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
    # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
    # rules and activating additional ones.

    # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
    # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
    # the material Icons class.

    # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
    # assets:
    #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
    #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
    #   - family: Schyler
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
    #         style: italic
    #   - family: Trajan Pro
    #     fonts:
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
    #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
    #         weight: 700
